MDFS is a massively-distributed, pluggable, cryptographic filesystem

MDFS has the following features and capabilities:

* Fully modular -- The file system is not a file system per se, as it is a filesystem kernel
The filesystem is made up of several modules. For example, a module for "local drives" would allow parts of the filesystem to be mapped locally

A filesystem for "network drives" would allow access to particular networked computers
However; the exposure of the filesystem to user-space does not distinguish individual devices or storage locations -- all are treated equally
Each module can register a number of nodes. Each node has a GUID. Each GUID corresponds to a physical device.
The filesystem will by default write each block (identified by a GUID) to 3 different nodes.
A minimum of 3 is recommended for fast and stable operations.
If a node is taken offline, it is immediately replicated to other available nodes.
If no nodes are available for a given block, an I/O error is returned for that portion of the filesystem. Other portions can still be accessed, and the filesystem is designed to allow for portions to go down without impacting the availability of the overall filesystem.
